# Lecture notes for Experimental Mathematics 2014

These are the lecture notes I have prepared for the subject Experimental Mathematics that I taught at The University of Melbourne in 2014. It was the first time teaching that subject and the notes are quite rough.

The notes are written mostly in markdown but with heavy use of latex blocks not only for formulas but also to make use of the tufte latex package.
