Groebner basis
==============

This section is a very brief introduction to Gröbner bases. For a more
thorough but readable introduction see @Groeb.

In many instances we are interested in the set of roots of a system of
nonlinear equations. For example, let $f_i\in\R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be
polynomials in $n$ variables with real coefficients. In geometry, a
variety $V(f_1,\ldots,f_s)$ can be defined as the set of all solutions
of the equations $$f_1=0,\quad f_2=0, \quad \ldots,\quad f_s=0,$$ or
more formally, if $S\subseteq\R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, V(S) =
{(a~1~,…,a~n~)^n^ | f(a~1~,…,a~n~)=0fS}. [Vdef] There are many
(numerical) algorithms for solving systems of equations, but these
generally do not take the geometry of the variety into account. The
computation of solutions for may drastically improve if the given system
of equations is transformed into a different system with the same
solutions. In the case of linear systems, such is achieved by
Gauss-Jordan elimination.

[One variable] [1vGroebner] Let $f(x)=x^3-2x^2+2x+8$ and
$g(x)=2x^2+3x+1$. We can **reduce** $f$ by $g$ by writing
$$f(x)= (\tfrac12 x -\tfrac74)g(x) + h(x),$$ where the remainder
$h(x)=\tfrac{27}{4}x+\tfrac{39}{4}$ is called the reduction of $f$ by
$g$.

To formalise a method similar to row-reduction for nonlinear equations
we first introduce the ideal generated by the polynomials
$f_1,\ldots, f_s$, denoted $\left\langle f_1,\ldots,f_s\right\rangle$,
$$\left\langle f_1,\ldots,f_s\right\rangle = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^s u_if_i\; |\; u_i\in\R[x_1,\ldots,x_n],\;i=1,\ldots,s\right\}.$$
The set $\{f_1,\ldots,f_s\}$ is called the generating set of the ideal
$I=\left\langle f_1,\ldots,f_s\right\rangle$, and the idea will be to
find a “better" generating set for the variety $V(I)$.

Consider now the ideal $I=\langle f,g\rangle$ where $f$ and $g$ are as
in Example [1vGroebner]. It is clear that this ideal can also be defined
as $I=\langle g,h\rangle$. In fact, reducing $g$ by $h$ and repeating
the process once more it follows that the ideal $I$ is generated by one
element, which in this case is the constant function (hence there are no
solutions to the equations $f(x)=g(x)=0$).

[1vIdealthm] Every ideal of $\R[x]$ is generated by one element.

Theorem [1vIdealthm] shows that a variety defined by $s$ equations
$$f_1=f_2=\ldots =f_s=0,$$ where $f_i\in\R[x],\; i=1,\ldots,s$ has
precisely the same set of solutions as the single equation $g=0$, where
$\langle f_1,\ldots,f_s\rangle = \langle g\rangle$. This function $g$ is
therefore the “best" generating set for $V(I)$.

Ordering
--------

In Example [1vGroebner] we implicitly used a choice of ordering of the
monomials: we used the highest degree term first in the reduction
process. When dealing with more than one variable, also a choice of
order among the various variables has to be made. The most common choice
of order among variables is the **degree lexicographical** order.

[Degree lexicographic (deglex) ordering] Let
$$\boldsymbol{p}=(p_1,\ldots,p_n),\;\boldsymbol{q}=(q_1,\ldots,q_n) \in\N^n,$$
and denote $x_1^{p_1}\cdots x_n^{p_n}$ by $\boldsymbol{x^p}$. Then we
write $$\boldsymbol{x^p} < \boldsymbol{x^q}\quad \text{if}\quad
\sum_i p_i < \sum_i q_i,$$ or, if $\sum_i p_i = \sum_i q_i$, the first
coordinates $p_i$ and $q_i$ from the left which are different satisfy
$p_i<q_i$. By convention, $x_1>x_2>\cdots >x_n$.

In the case of two variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, the deglex order gives
$$1 < x_2 < x_1 < x_2^2 < x_1 x_2 < x_1^2 < x_2^3 < x_1x_2^2 < x_1^2x_2 < x_1^3 < \ldots.$$

Multivariate reduction
----------------------

Given an order such as deglex, we can reduce a system of equations by a
set of predefined functions, by systematically removing the largest
monomials. This is by no means a unique process, as can be seen in the
next example.

[2vreduce] Let $f(x,y)=y^2x-x$, and let $I=\langle f_1,f_2\rangle$ where
$f_1(x,y)=yx-y$, $f_2(x,y)=y^2-x$. Using the deglex ordering with $y>x$,
we find $$f(x,y)=yf_1(x,y)+f_2(x,y),$$ and hence has zero remainder.
However, if we first reduce with respect to $f_2$, we find
$$f(x,y)=xf_2(x,y) + x^2-x.$$ In this case, the remainder $x^2-x$ is
non-zero but reduced with respect to $\{f_1,f_2\}$.

The ambiguity in Example [2vreduce] can be resolved by finding another
generating set for $I$. This finally leads to the definition of a
Gröbner basis:

[Gröbner basis] A set of nonzero polynomials $G=\{g_1,\ldots,g_s\}$
contained in an ideal $I$, is called a Gröbner basis for $I$ if for all
$f\in \R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ the remainder of the division of $f$ by $G$ is
unique.

The classical algorithm for computing Gröbner bases is called
Buchberger’s algorithm.

The 3-colour problem
====================

This section is an adaption of Section 2.7 from @Groeb, in which we
illustrate how the technique of Gröbner bases can be used to determine
whether a graph can be 3-coloured.

Consider the following problem. Given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices with
at most one edge between any two vertices. Can we colour the vertices,
using only three colours, in such a way that no two vertices connected
by an edge have the same colour? In order to use Gröbner bases we have
to capture this problem in a set of polynomial equations, which is done
as follows. Let the three colours be represented by the three cube roots
of unity $1,\xi,\xi^2$ where $\xi^3=1$. Each vertex is to be assigned
one of these three colours, and this can be represented by the equations
x~i~^3^-1=0,1in. [vertex] However, if vertex $i$ and $j$ are adjacent
their colours need to be different, i.e. $x_i\neq x_j$. This can be
transformed into an equation by observing that
$0=x_i^3-x_j^3 = (x_i-x_j)(x_i^2 +x_ix_j+x_j^2)$. Hence, if $i$ and $j$
are adjacent vertices with different colours, we must have that x~i~^2^
+x~i~x~j~+x~j~^2^=0. [edge]

Let $I$ be the ideal of $\C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ generated by the
polynomials in and . Then, the graph $G$ is 3-colourable if
$V(I)\neq \varnothing$. To establish whether or not $V(I)=\varnothing$,
we compute a Gröbner basis $B$ for $I$. If $1\in B$, then
$V(I)=\varnothing$, as in Example [1vGroebner], and otherwise
$V(I)\neq \varnothing$.

Consider the graph in Figure [3colorgraph]. Using `GroebnerBasis[]`,
determine whether or not $G$ is 3-colourable. If $G$ is 3-colourable,
find a 3-colouring.
