Definite Integrals
==================

In this section we will evaluate some definite integrals by first
evaluating them numerically and then identifying the answer using PSLQ.

Evaluate
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{1}{(x+y)\sqrt{(1-x)(1-y)}} \,\d x \,\d y.$$

Evaluate
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{2(1-x)}{(1-xy)\log xy} \,\d x \,\d y.$$
Evaluate the integral numerically, note that it converges slowly.
Identify your answer using PSLQ and then prove the final result.

Evaluate
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{2(1-x)}{(1+xy)\log xy} \,\d x \,\d y.$$

Bifurcation points of the logistic map
======================================

The logistic map is the chaotic iteration x~n+1~ = r x~n~(1-x~n~).
[eq:logistic] When $1<r<3$ this map is regular and iterates to the fixed
point $p_0$ determined by $$f(p_0)=p_0,$$ where $$f(x)=rx(1-x).$$ The
fixed point is thus given by $p_0=(r-1)/r$. This fixed point is stable
when the Jacobian is less than one, i.e.,
$$\left| f'(p_0)\right| <1 \quad \Leftrightarrow\quad \left| r(1-2p_0) \right| <1,$$
which leads to the condition that $r<3$. At $r=3$ the map becomes
unstable and the map jumps back and forth between two values of $x$.
This is the onset of a so-called period doubling bifurcation, which is
given by the fixed point $p_1$ determined by the double iterate
$f_2(p_1) \equiv f(f(p_1))=p_1$. The quickest way to see this is to
compute the discriminant of =r^2^x^2^-r(1+r)x+1+r=0, [eq:2ndBifur] which
is $$r^2(1+r)(r-3).$$ Hence, has real solutions for $r\geq 3$. The onset
of higher order bifurcation points can be computed in a similar way, but
the degree of the polynomial that has $r$ as a root increases rapidly.

Compute the values of $r$ denoting the onset of a 3-cycle and 4-cycle.

The bifurcation diagram of the logistic map shows the values of $x$ to
which the iteration converges as a function of $r$. This diagram is
given in Figure [fig:bifur], which was generated by the following
`Mathematica` code,

$$\begin{aligned}
&\texttt{Clear[f];}\\
&\texttt{f[1,r\_,x\_]=r*x*(1-x);}\\
&\texttt{f[n\_,r\_,x\_]:=Nest[f[1,r,\#1]\&,x,n];}\\
&\texttt{l=Flatten[Table[\{r,f[100+k,r,0.364]\},\{r,2.9,4,0.001\},}\\
&\hspace{1.5cm}\texttt{\{k,0,40\}],1];}\\
&\texttt{ListPlot[l,PlotStyle->PointSize[0.002]];}\end{aligned}$$

It is clear that for $r<3$ there is only one fixed point. For
$3<r<1+\sqrt{6}$ there is a period-2 orbit and at $r=1+\sqrt{6}$ a
period-4 orbit becomes stable. Computing the onset of the period-8 orbit
is more difficult, and in this section we shall use the PSLQ algorithm
to achieve that.

![Bifurcation diagram of the logistic map](Bifurcation.eps "fig:")
[fig:bifur]

The onset of the period-8 orbit can be computed numerically as follows
@BBKW06. Let $f_8(x)$ be the eigth-times iterate of $f(x)$and let
$g_8(x)=f_8(x)-x$. Given some initial $r$ slightly less than the
expected bifurcation point, a “comb" of function values $g_8(x)$ at $n$
evenly spaced $x$ values (with spacing $h_x$) is computed near the limit
of the iteration $x_{n+1}=f_8(x_n)$. The comb is constructed such that
it has $n/2$ positive function values of $g_8(x)$, followed by $n/2$
negative function values. Then $r$ is incremented by some small amount
$h_r$ and the comb is reevaluated. This process is repeated until two
sign changes are observed among the $n$ function values. This means that
a bifurcation occurred just prior to the current value of $r$. The value
of $r$ is then restored to its previous value and the values of $h_r$
and $h_x$ are reduced to make the “comb" finer. This process is
continued, moving the value of $r$ and its associated comb back and
forth near the bifurcation point with progressively smaller values of
$h_r$.

In this way we can compute the third bifurcation point $B_3$ to a very
high precision in just a few seconds. There is a `Mathematica` notebook
`LogisticMap.nb` available from the subject webpage

<http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~s620445/>

that does just that.

[bifurpol] Compute the bifurcation point $B_3$, where we have the onset
of a period-8 orbit, to high enough precision to be able to recognise it
using PSLQ.

Two important numbers associated to iterated functions are Feigenbaum’s
constants $\alpha$ and $\delta$ @Feig. These numbers are defined by
$$\delta=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{B_n-B_{n-1}}{B_{n+1}-B_n},$$
where $B_n$ is the $n$th bifurcation point, i.e. the point of onset of a
period $2^n$ cycle, and
$$\alpha=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{d_n}{d_{n+1}},$$ where $d_n$ is
the value of the $x$-value nearest to 0 in the $n$th cycle. The values
of these constants are believed to be universal, i.e. independent of the
details of the iteration as long as the iteration has a quadratic
maximum. The values of $\alpha$ and $\delta$ have been computed to very
high accuracy, but their nature is unknown... The high precision data
for $\alpha$ and $\delta$ is available from

<http://pi.lacim.uqam.ca/eng/table_en.html>

Their approximate values are given by

$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha&= 2.502907875095892822283902873218\ldots,\\
\delta&= 4.669201609102990671853203820466\ldots.\end{aligned}$$

[Proof of Exercise [bifurpol]] The bifurcation point $B_3$ is algebraic,
it is the smallest positive real root of the polynomial

$$\begin{gathered}
4913 + 2108r^2 - 604r^3 - 977r^4 + 8r^5 + 44r^6 + 392r^7 - 193r^8 \\
- 40r^9 + 48r^{10} - 12r^{11} + r^{12},
\label{B3pol}\end{gathered}$$

which is found by PSQL using as input vector
$$\texttt{Table[r\^{}n,\{n,0,12\}]},$$ where $r$ is the numerical value
of $B_3$ found by the “combing" algorithm described above. This result
can be proved using a Gröbner basis. The notion of a Gröbner basis,
which results from a generalisation of row-reduction for systems of
non-linear equations, will be described in the next section. Its most
important property is that the roots of the polynomials in a Gröbner
basis are the same as those in the original system of equations.

We thus need to find the equations that describe $B_3$, and these are
given by the onset of instability of a 4-cycle:

$$\begin{aligned}
&x_{i+1}=rx_i(1-x_i)\quad(i=1,2,3),\qquad x_1=rx_4(1-x_4),\\
&|r^4(1-2x_1)(1-2x_2)(1-2x_3)(1-2x_4)|=1, \end{aligned}$$

where the last equation represents the stability of the cycle, which
must be $-1$ or $1$ for a bifurcation point. The `Mathematica` code

$$\begin{gathered}
\texttt{GroebnerBasis[\{x2-r x1(1-x1), x3-r x2(1-x2), x4-r x3(1-x3),}\\
\texttt{x1-r x4(1-x4), r\^{}4(1-2\,x1)(1-2\,x2)(1-2\,x3)(1-2\,x4)+1\}, r,}\\
\texttt{\{x1,x2,x3,x4\},MonomialOrder $\rightarrow$  EliminationOrder]},\end{gathered}$$

produces a polynomial in $r$ from which $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ and $x_4$
have been eliminated. Factoring this polynomial using `Factor[]`
produces as the factor with the smallest positive real root.
